# VoiceBox Changelog

## 3.1.0
Fresh Changelog for the new version because I've been real bad at keeping up with these
- Actually made the status codes more generic as promised
- Made a few minor changes to word lists here and there
- Building off recent developments we now have a Catawauling option, inserts random nyaas into your sentences, occasionally forces a cat pun, and makes sure cats speak about themselves properly
