# Bambi Dumbtalk Script

This script automatically replace what you type in discord chat with more Bambi-like stuff.

## Features
- Every `i` or `me` become `bambi`, `myself` becomes `herself`...
- Automatically conjugate most common verbs to third person when they are refering to you (ie. `i obey` becomes `bambi obeys`)
- Replace some words with ones more appropriate for Bambi (ie. `tasty` => `yummy`; `best` => `bestest`...)
- Add Words randomizer (ie. `breasts` can produce `boobz`, `bewbz`, `honkers`...)
- Some words and sentences can randomly appear while you type (ie. `like...`, `humm...`, `... *god bambi is horny*...`...) 
- Add Triggers macros (ie. `!gg` produces the GG trigger, in bold font)

## Instalation instructions
- Download and install autohotkey 1.1 : https://autohotkey.com/download/1.1/
- Download the script and extract it to a location of your choosing (keep the files hierarchy as it is: "Bambi Dumbtalk Script.ahk" and the "SubScript" folder containing the other scripts).
- Run the main script (Bambi Dumbtalk Script.ahk) by double-clicking on it (or right-click => "Run Script"). And don't try to run the sub scripts, it won't work, and you don't need to.
- Now it should work on the windows Discord app.

## Additional notes
- You can pause the script by right-clicking on its tray icon (on the lower right of your screen) then click on "Suspend Hotkeys". You just need to click on it again to unpause it.
- Keep in mind that, by default, the script is only active on the desktop Discord app. if you want to change that, you need to edit the script (right-click => "Edit Script") and remove or edit the line "#IfWinActive, Discord". if removed, the script will run everywhere. You can also change it so it runs in other specific apps (ie. "#IfWinActive, Chrome" or "#IfWinActive, Firefox").
- If the script is producing weird stuff, like words cut in half, you may have several instances of the script running. Please check in the taskbar, and remove all other scripts

## Known bugs
- Some verbs will sometimes automatically be conjugated to third person when they shouldn't, seems to be a limitation with Autohotkey

## Contributing
The author of this script is curently looking for help to populate the script with new words, especially simple replacement for complexe words.
